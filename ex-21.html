            <ul>
                <li>
                    The "relative" position allows your element to be "moved" around the screen, away from where it would normally be on the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When we set an element's "position" property to anything but "static", it can be moved with "top", "right", "bottom", and "left" properties. This includes "relative".
                </li>
                <li>
                    &lt;div&gt; Static element Syntax with red and blue blocks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/b-syntax-of-static-elements.png"
                                alt="Syntax of Static Elements"
                                width="275"
                            >
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is possible to break #div-b out of the normal flow by changing its position to relative, and then move it from the "left" and "top" sides by 25px:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/c-syntax-of-relative-elements.png"

                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/d-rendered-relative-syntax.png"
                                alt="Rendered Syntax of Relative Elements"
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/e-rendered-relative-syntax-with-top-and-left-properties.png"
                                alt="Syntax of Relative Elements with top and left properties"
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The "top" and "left" properties can also be set with relative units like 5em and 50%.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Note: </b>
                            Keep in mind that "top" moves an element down the screen, "right", moves it to the left, "bottom" moves it up, and "left" moves it right. Imagine something is pushing the element box from that side (i.e., push the element 25px to the right from the "left" side).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- & This section will discuss what z-index is -->
        <section>
            <h2>🌸 Z-Index 🌸</h2>
            <hr class="title-divider">
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you work with "position:relative" long enough, you'll notice how some elements will overlap other elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you don't want this, try using the "z-index" property. This changes the way elements are "layered" on the webpage, regardless of when they appear on the HTML file. Just like magic🪄
                </li>
                <li>
                    The following is the syntax for two static &lt;div&gt; elements along with using "z-index" through adding another &lt;div&gt; element, #div-c to the mix.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/f-syntax-of-relative-elements-and-z-index.png" alt="Syntax of Relative Elements and z-index"
                                width="275"
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This will render relative elements:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <img

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This will render relative elements with the "top" and "bottom" properties:
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                            This will render relative elements with the "z-index" properties:
